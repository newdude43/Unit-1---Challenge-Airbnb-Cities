Unit 1 - Challenge: Airbnb Cities

Whatâ€™s the most expensive listing? What else can you tell me about the listing?
What neighborhoods seem to be the most popular?
What time of year is the cheapest time to go to your city? What about the busiest?

Answer 1:  La Jolla Gem with a view!
SELECT 
	name,
	neighbourhood,
	room_type,
	number_of_reviews,
	price
FROM 
	listings
ORDER BY price DESC 
LIMIT 3


This listing is in La Jolla and is an entire home/apartment listing.  It does not have any reviews.



Answer 2: 

SELECT 
	neighbourhood,
SUM (number_of_reviews)
FROM 
	listings
GROUP BY neighbourhood
ORDER BY SUM (number_of_reviews) DESC

Mission Bay, Pacific Beach, North Hills, Ocean Beach, La Jolla

 


Answer 3:  I worked off of the calendar.csv file for this exercise:

SELECT avg(price)
FROM calendar
GROUP BY date

This is what I would normally start out with.  Due to the dollar signs in the prices listed, the data required substantial cleaning to provide the required answers.  My mentor provided step by step instructions on how to find the answers.
